# Colorado Historical Maps
## Description
This collection of maps covers the time period from the origins of the Territory of Colorado through the early twentieth century. These maps reveal the growth of communities around Colorado, with a focus on the city of Boulder and other towns in Boulder county. Thematic maps showing early resource extraction, agriculture, irrigation systems, transportation, homesteading patterns, and tourism add to the story of the state’s development. A highlight of this collection is a series of most of Louis Nell’s maps of the state of Colorado, from 1880-1907, which offer a changing portrait of the state in exceptional detail.
